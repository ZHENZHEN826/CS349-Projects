# CS 349 X Windows and XLib Example Code


To make ("compile and link") an example, use the included makefile with 
the name of cpp file passed as a variable. For example, to make hello.cpp:

```bash
	make NAME="hello"
```

Then, to run:

```bash
    ./hello 
```

Or you can even compile, link, and run in one step:

    make run NAME="hello"
```
